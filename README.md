# Version Control With Git
## Git
Git is a powerful version control tool that allows you to manage the flow of versioning of your project. You can create different branches to manage different features or versions, roll back previous commits, and even fork repositories to make your own changes. Git is the backbone that does all the calculations that allow the version control to work. It also acts as a sort of protocol too, as many Git programs (like github) work off Git itself and it's feature set.

## Github
Github is the web platform that allows users to freely store their Git repositories, and view it in a nice format. Users can also add friends, search for open source code, and many other things. Github allows you to create a homepage for your projects and yourself as well, through Github pages.
